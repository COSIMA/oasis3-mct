set faqdata($faqname-body) "The information written in a tab is validated ONLY through the process button, at the lower left. The states are :\n  - A red cross for an invalid information \n  - An orange interrogation mark for an information in unknown state \n  - A green V mark for a validated information \n \n After the tab processing, the validation of a level is the weakest state of all of its childrens. For example, if a tab is red (invalid), there is at least and without a doubt one of its children or grandchildren information which is invalid."

However, the user can get back to normal state using the Escape key to interrupt the process if it takes too much time. \n Note that some low level processes such as external tool execution (Paraview, Fortran) will refuse the interruption. These process must be taken care using the task manager of the computer."

Use the magnifier button to increase the size of the log window.  \n 2 - Check that you are using the correct Plug-in for your situation. (see nest FAQ item)  \n 3 - Check that the inputs given to the plugin are correctly set : login, writable directory, etc...  \n 4 - Share this error, either by reporting it to the manager of your installation, or by sumitting a query on the Redmine website, with the data needed to reproduce the problem.

set faqdata($faqname-body) "Each computing situation is different. Your computing situation  is the combination of two informations : where do you run the GUI ? where do you run the tools associated to your application ? \nTherefore each site have its own set of plugins. At cerfacs, we have for example cerfacs_formation (for GUI and tool execution on the formation room) or cerfacs_neptune_ssh (for massively parallel code execution on the cluster NEPTUNE). \nIt is a good thing to know clearly what is the range of applications given by your plugin. Ask your code manager about this topic for precise informations. "

set faqdata($faqname-body) "On Mac OSX remote execution , e.g. execution on a UNIX platform, trough a terminal to a Mac OSX display, some text entries canot be written. This is due to compatibility issues between different layers of window managers. To resolve the problem, set the parameter Focus correction OSX/X11 to 1 in your config.xml "

set faqdata($faqname-title) "(Mac OSX) The key ^ or Â¨ crashes the application"

For applications generating LaTeX documents, a special widget gives among other shortcuts, a macro to insert \^{ } directly on a selected letter."
