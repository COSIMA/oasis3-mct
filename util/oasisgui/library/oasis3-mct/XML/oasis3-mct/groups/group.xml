Please enter all the grouped field names that will be used
by the GUI using the button "add groups" and double clicking in the different rows created.
The name must be validated using the button "Enter" of the keyboard.
This is a symbolic name used by the GUI to manage easily the fields of a same group.
It will not appear in the configuration file. 
The "load" button is useless for the OASIS3-MCT application.[] 
A blue (?), located at the right bottom of this window, gives more information on the data to fill up.

[section=Grouping coupling fields]
OASIS3-MCT supports exchange of multiple fields via a single communication.
In the component model codes, these fields are defined as usual, and sent (``put'') or received (``get'')
one at a time.

More details on this new functionality can be found in the User Guide, appendix B.2.4.

<docuold>
Inside OASIS3-MCT, the fields are stored and a
single mapping and send or receive instruction is in fact executed for all fields.
This is useful in cases where multiple fields have
the same coupling transformations and to reduce communication costs by aggregating
multiple fields into a single communication.
The coupling fields must be sent and received in the same order as they are defined in the corresponding
single entry of the namcouple.[]
Note that if a LOCTRAN transformation is needed for these multiple fields, it is necessary to
define one restart file per each group of fields. []
