Enter the name and characteristics of the grids involved in the coupling 
using the button "add Grids", double clicking on the new row created 
and filling the part "no label" under "Grid names". 
The name must be validated using the button "Enter" of the keyboard. 
The dimensions of the grids are optional, but if they are specified for one grid, they 
must be specified for all the grids. 
The "load" button is useless for the OASIS3-MCT application.[]
The blue (?), located at the right bottom of this window, gives more information on each data to fill up.

[section=Grids]

[item=Name of the grids:] The source grid names and the target grid names, coded on 4 characters,
correpond to the prefix of the source grid names and the
target grid names in the grid data files grids.nc, masks.nc and areas.nc (see the section 2.3 and 5.1
of the User for more details). 
[item=Characteristics:] For each grid, Periodical and Regional 
correspond to the grid first dimension characteristic
[item=Overlapping points:] Overlapping points correspond to the 
first dimension number of overlapping grid points.[]
[item=Dimensions:] The arrays containing the grid information are dimensioned 
(ni, nj), where ni and nj are the grid first and second dimension. Unstructured grids or other grids expressed with 1D 
vectors are supported by setting ni to the total number of grid points and nj to 1. []
