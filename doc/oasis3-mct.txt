- should encapsulate var, partition, coupling data in a datatype and
  make them allocates, not static with max.
- need to read namcouple and bcast
- support partitions 0,1,2,3 as before + 4 which is list of points where
  kparal(1) = 4
  kparal(2) = npoints
  kparal(3:npoints+2) = list of points in global index
- need to fix mpi2 initialization in prism_method_init
- need time manager
- need variable seq support
- initialization order, nulprt, mpi, compid

- do we want private module variables with get/put
  do we want public module variables with naming convention

fields in namcouple that don't appear in model def_var are ignored.
fields in def_var that don't appear in namcouple are ignored.
fields in def_var that don't result in an action via namcouple and other models' def_var are ignored.


once a coupling is established, both the get and put sides MUST
  get and put EVERY variable on at least the coupler period.

want to add mapping option to output and input (needs extensions to namcouple first)
