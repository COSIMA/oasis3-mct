One-line Summary:  Extend mpi-serial support, speed up of avect_copy code

Purpose of changes: Move local modifications in mpi-serial to trunk, add 
	code to allow non-string lookups in avect


Describe any changes made to build system:
Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: 

	These changes involved modifications to the mct code, as well as
	to the CESM driver. Essentially: rather than computing the shared
	indices between two attribute vectors every time an mct copy is
	performed, I have added some data structures and subroutines that
	allow you to compute these shared indices once, store them, then
	pass them to the copy routines as an optional argument. If
	present, the copy routines will use this optional argument rather
	than computing the shared indices; if absent, the copy routines
	will behave the same as before (but I refactored them somewhat to
	avoid duplicated code).

Purpose of changes: fix problem when targetAV enters

  Normally this won't be an issue because the targetAV
  enters with zero values, doesn't need to be unpermuted
  or is filled completely when rearranged.
