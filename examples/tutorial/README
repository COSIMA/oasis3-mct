The "tutorial" toy model reproduces the coupling between two simple models, 
"model1" and "model2", with the OASIS3-MCT coupler.  

The time step of "model1" (see model1.F90) is 3600 seconds.
The time step of "model2" (see model2.F90) is 1800 seconds 
The run lasts 6 hours. The "model1" runs on a logically-rectangular (182x149) 
grid and "model2" also runs on a logically-rectangular (96x72) grid.

The coupling period of the field sent from model1 (FSENDOCN) to model2 
(FRECVATM) is 7200 seconds.
The coupling period of the field sent from model2 (FSENDATM) to model2 
(FRECVOCN) is 10800 seconds.
In addition, model1 outputs FOCNWRIT to a file every 7200 seconds.
 
At each timestep "model1" (see model1.F90) calls oasis_get to possibly 
receive the field "FRECVOCN", e.g. its boundary conditions produced by 
"model2", and then calls oasis_put to possibly sends its coupling field 
"FSENDOCN" to "model2" and to write FOCNWRIT to a file. Of course, these 
actions are actually performed only at the timesteps that match the 
respective coupling frequencies.

At each timestep "model2" (see model2.F90) calls oasis_get to possibly 
receive the field "FRECVATM", e.g. its boundary conditions produced by 
"model1", and then calls oasis_put to possibly sends its coupling field 
"FSENDATM" to "model1". Of course, these actions are actually performed 
only at the timesteps that match the respective coupling frequencies.

"FSENDOCN" is interpolated on the source side with a bilinear interpolation
 using the MAPPING option with the user's predefined mapping file 
my_remapping_file_bilinear.nc. "FRECATM" is interpolated with a bilinear 
interpolation using the SCRIP library. 

All the documentation about the coupler OASIS3-MCT coupler can be found 
in the directory oasis3-mct/doc and on the IS-ENES web site at 
http://oasis.enes.org in USER SUPPORT.

This toy is used during the trainings on OASIS to couple step by step the
toy models model1.F90 and model2.F90 (see tutorial.pdf)

To run directly the toy in the coupled configuration copy without implementing
the coupling steps :
cp model1.F90_TP model1.F90
cp model2.F90_TP model2.F90
cp data_oasis3/namcouple_TP data_oasis3/namcouple
adapt run_tutorial to your platform and run it :
./run_tutorial
